# Pokemon Team Builder
## Description
This piece of code was my first "big" project, and is intended to allow users their freedom to type in a pokemon's name and receive the stats of that pokemon displayed in front of them! Trust me, 12 year old me would've loved to have something like this. You can then pull up a second pokemon and compare the stats of the two pokemon, and pick one to add to your team.
